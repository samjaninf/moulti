# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for its CLI (Command-Line Interface), i.e. for the `moulti` command.
Although Moulti's Python packages, modules and functions are obviously available, they do not constitute a public API yet.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Fix rare "unknown action" error message.

## [1.34.0] - 2025-03-16

### Changed

- Unless `MOULTI_NAME_THREADS=no` is set, system threads get assigned meaningful names:
  `moulti:main`, `network-loop`,`exec-command`, `export-to-dir`, `|step_name`, `>step_name`, `thread-pool`.

## [1.33.0] - 2025-02-26

### Changed

- [moulti.run](https://moulti.run/) is the new official documentation. It replaces `Documentation.md`.

### Fixed

- Running `moulti` without any argument used to crash since v1.30.0.

## [1.32.0] - 2025-02-13

### Changed

- `moulti run`: `MOULTI_RUN_OUTPUT=harvest` is now the default behaviour instead of `ignore`.

### Fixed

- `moulti run`: make output harvesting more reactive.

## [1.31.0] - 2025-02-03

This release finally fixes a bug initially reported in August 2024. It took significant efforts to diagnose the root cause.
Special thanks go to [huyz](https://github.com/huyz), whose thorough cooperation made it possible to tackle this issue.

### Added

- Ansible callback plugin: the `MOULTI_ANSIBLE_WRITE_MODE` environment variable defines whether to use `moulti pass` or `moulti step append`

### Fixed

- Ansible callback plugin: fix a major bug that used to block the display at arbitrary points in a playbook

## [1.30.1] - 2025-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix a race condition that was liable to generate (innocuous) error messages in the Moulti console after running `moulti pass`:
  - `Invalid file descriptor: -1`
  - '<socket.socket fd=xx, family=1, type=1, proto=0, laddr=xxx.socket> is not registered'
- `moulti pass step_id < empty_regular_file` used to block on macOS; `moulti load` was also affected.
- Handle EMSGSIZE when sending file descriptors.

## [1.30.0] - 2025-01-23

### Changed

- `moulti run` now suffixes the instance name with its process id (e.g. `default-1234` instead of `default`).
  This helps prevent clashes and makes it possible to run various tools concurrently without having to worry about such details.
  This behaviour can be prevented by setting the `MOULTI_RUN_NO_SUFFIX` environment variable or using the `-n` / `--no-suffix` command-line option.
  The behaviour of `moulti init` remains unchanged.
- `moulti run`, `moulti diff run`, `moulti manpage run`: it is no longer mandatory to use `--` to separate Moulti arguments and the command to be run.

### Fixed

- `moulti-scoreboard.bash` example script: make scoreboard control path instance-specific.

## [1.29.0] - 2025-01-12

### Changed

- console: abridge message strings longer than 100 characters

### Fixed

- diff, load, manpage, step delete: improve pipelining so as to prevent deadlocks
- server-side networking: use non-blocking methods to deal with non-blocking sockets
- `moulti run path/to/non_executable_script` used to crash

## [1.28.0] - 2024-12-29

### Changed

- Moulti now requires Textual 1.0.x
- When searching text, the `[esc] Cancel` keybinding, which used to be shown in 1st position in the footer, is now shown in 3rd position
- `Ctrl+c` no longer exits Moulti: use `Ctrl+q` instead; `q` still works
- Input fields now support:
  - text selection through mouse or Shift+left/right; Ctrl+Shift+left/right works too
  - copy/paste through Ctrl+x/c/v

## [1.27.0] - 2024-12-28

### Changed

- Moulti now requires Textual 0.89.1

## [1.26.0] - 2024-12-27

### Changed

- Moulti now requires Textual 0.88.1

## [1.25.0] - 2024-12-26

### Added

- `MOULTI_CUSTOM_CSS` users: combined with `offset`, `position: absolute` enables various interesting hacks (e.g. multiple steps per row)
- New example script: `moulti-scoreboard.bash`

### Changed

- Moulti now requires Textual 0.87.1

## [1.24.0] - 2024-12-19

### Changed

- Moulti now requires Textual 0.86.3
- Minor color changes: input fields, buttons, progress bar, some texts in light mode.
- `MOULTI_CUSTOM_CSS` users: specify `& CollapsibleTitle { color: ...; }` to alter the default step title color; an example is available in the documentation.

## [1.23.2] - 2024-12-17

### Fixed

- Fixed a double-close issue liable to affect any file descriptor inside a given Python process after a Moulti instance exited.
- Introduced snapshot testing and continuous integration.

## [1.23.1] - 2024-11-17

### Fixed

- `moulti init` now exits with a non-zero return code when it cannot listen to clients.
- Ansible callback plugin: fix `unexpected keyword argument 'caplevel'` warning

## [1.23.0] - 2024-10-31

### Changed

- Moulti now requires Textual == 0.83.0

### Fixed

- Focus indicators: fix rendering issue induced by Textual 0.84.0

## [1.22.0] - 2024-10-27

### Changed

- Moulti now requires Textual >= 0.83.0

### Fixed

- `moulti init` used to crash with Textual >= 0.83.0:
  ```
  Screen.ALLOW_IN_MAXIMIZED_VIEW = '#header,SearchInputWidget,' + Screen.ALLOW_IN_MAXIMIZED_VIEW
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "NoneType") to str
  ```

## [1.21.0] - 2024-09-29

### Changed

- `moulti run` now sets `ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=yes` when Ansible is detected, thus generating colors in "PLAY RECAP" and diff (`-D` command-line option)

### Fixed

- The console is now based on Textual's `Log` widget instead of `RichLog`; this prevents a
  [bug introduced in Textual 0.80.0](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5024) that affects the console when
  it becomes visible for the first time.

## [1.20.0] - 2024-09-22

### Added

- `moulti diff` lists generated widgets if the environment variable `MOULTI_DIFF_VERBOSE` is set
- `moulti manpage` lists generated widgets if the environment variable `MOULTI_MANPAGE_VERBOSE` is set
- the environment variable `MOULTI_QUIT_POLICY` defines how Moulti should behave upon quitting
- steps can now be assigned the `inactive` class, which turns them gray

### Changed

- Ansible callback plugin: steps with "skipping" and "included" lines are affected the new `inactive` class

## [1.19.0] - 2024-09-15

### Added

- `moulti diff`: [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) integration
- `moulti diff`: display number of added (+) and removed (-) lines for each hunk
- `delete` commands now accept multiple ids, e.g. `moulti step delete step_1 step_2 step_3`
- Pressing `f` maximizes the currently focused step log (similar to zoom pane in tmux)

### Changed

- Moulti now requires Textual >= 0.79.0
- pipeline() now writes errors on stderr; this affects moulti `load`, `diff` and `manpage` commands.

## [1.18.1] - 2024-09-09

### Fixed

- `moulti-man` and `moulti manpage` used to ignore the last section of all manpages.

## [1.18.0] - 2024-09-08

### Added

- Text search: it is now possible to search steps (+ the title) for a given pattern (plain or regex, case-sensitive or not).
- The search widget offers an in-memory, non-persistent history.

### Changed

- The console is now shown or hidden using `z` instead of `n`.
- The console now grabs the focus, which makes it easier to scroll.

### Fixed

- Help screen: mention `ctrl+pgup` and `ctrl+pgdn`.

## [1.17.0] - 2024-08-25

### Added

- the environment variable `MOULTI_ASKPASS_DEFAULT_PROMPT` defines the prompt shown by `moulti-askpass` if none was passed on the command line
- Ansible-specific variants of `moulti-askpass`:
  - `moulti-askpass-become-password`
  - `moulti-askpass-connection-password`
  - `moulti-askpass-vault-client`

### Fixed

- Ansible callback plugin: override these `ansible-playbook` command-line options to prevent it from reading passwords through the current tty:
  - `-k`, `-ask-pass`
  - `-K`, `--ask-become-pass`
  - `-J`, `--ask-vault-pass`, `--ask-vault-password`

## [1.16.0] - 2024-08-23

### Added

- `moulti step`: add options `--auto-scroll` and `--no-auto-scroll` to control inner auto-scrolling
- `moulti pass`: significant performance improvements
- the environment variable `MOULTI_TAB_SIZE` controls the expansion of tab characters passed to steps

### Fixed

- Steps with a horizontal scrollbar had an extra line above it

## [1.15.0] - 2024-08-11

### Added

- `Ctrl+t` / `Ctrl+y` jumps to the previous/next unanswered question
- `O` / `X` collapses/expands new steps
- the environment variable `MOULTI_ENFORCE_COLLAPSIBLE` does the same as soon as Moulti starts
- `Ctrl+o` / `Ctrl+x` collapses/expands both existing and new steps

### Changed

- Moulti now requires Textual >= 0.76.0
- Footer: the `Dark/Light` keybinding now displays either "Dark" or "Light"
- Footer: the `Lock scroll` keybinding now displays either "Lock scroll" or "Unlock scroll"

- Ansible callback plugin: support `prompt_until()` and the `pause` module
- quit dialog: buttons now feature keyboard accelerators

### Changed

- `moulti pass --read-size` now defaults to `8192`.
- `moulti run`: hitting `Ctrl+c` multiple times now navigates through the quit dialog and eventually terminates the process before exiting.

### Fixed

- `moulti run`: `MOULTI_RUN_OUTPUT=harvest moulti run -- bash -c 'echo a; sleep 3600'` would block upon selecting "Quit and leave the process running in the background".

## [1.13.0] - 2024-07-21

### Added

- help screen (`h`)
- Ansible callback plugin: handle `vars_prompt` using inputquestion widgets.

### Changed
